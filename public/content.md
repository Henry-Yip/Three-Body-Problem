# Section 1

## Subsection 1.1

Inside a MathJax block element, one might use both Latex inline math, such as $(x)$ or $\frac{25x}{10} = 2^{10}$, but then also switch to Latex display math, like

$$\sum_{n = 100}^{1000}\left(\frac{10\sqrt{n}}{n}\right)$$

and then continue with inline math.

### Topic 1.1.1

Inside a MathJax block element, one might use both Latex inline math, such as $(x)$ or $\frac{25x}{10} = 2^{10}$, but then also switch to Latex display math, like

$$\sum_{n = 100}^{1000}\left(\frac{10\sqrt{n}}{n}\right)$$

and then continue with inline math.

#### Detail 1.1.1.1

Inside a MathJax block element, one might use both Latex inline math, such as $(x)$ or $\frac{25x}{10} = 2^{10}$, but then also switch to Latex display math, like

$$\sum_{n = 100}^{1000}\left(\frac{10\sqrt{n}}{n}\right)  + \sum_{n = 100}^{1000}\left(\frac{10\sqrt{n}}{n}\right) + \sum_{n = 100}^{1000}\left(\frac{10\sqrt{n}}{n}\right)$$

and then continue with inline math.
